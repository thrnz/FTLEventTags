# FTLEventTags

When is a Crew Kill no better than a Ship Kill? Which Blue Option gives the best reward? What are the chances of losing crew to Giant Alien Spiders?

This mod tags approximately 1000 lines of in-game text to show the possible outcomes of various choices and events. No information is displayed that can't otherwise be found in the game files, or from Googling dialogue. It doesn't effect the gameplay mechanics themselves in any way.

Tags include: 
* Choice outcomes, including Blue Options
* Rewards from ship/crew kills
* Surrender/escape triggers and timers
* Enemy ship classes
* Weapon effect (breach/stun/fire) chances (added to weapon descriptions)
* Beacon count (Stores/Empty/Nebula etc) per sector type (added to the first beacon of each sector)

This mod is useful for players wanting to learn the possible results of ingame events. It is also useful for players wanting to play optimally without having to refer to the wiki or XML diving.

## Notes
 * To avoid giving players an unfair advantage, some dialogue remains untagged or tagged ambiguously. For example the outcomes of the real/decoy Rebel ship fights in the Engi Homeworlds quest, or the 'moon counting' event.
 * I'm unsure what the 'chance', 'min', 'max', and 'timer' values actually mean for surrenders and escapes, but have tagged them anyway 'as is' from the XMLs.
 * Works with FTL v1.5.13. For FTL v1.6, use [this](https://github.com/thrnz/FTLEventTags1.6).
 * Consistent with FTL v1.5.13

## To-do
 * ~~Re-do screenshots.~~
 * Double check quest reference

## Example tags:

One of 3 possible outcomes: either a ship fight against a pirate class ship with default rewards, nothing, or a free random weapon.

* [ x2 Nil | Crew+ | Crew- (CB+) ]

One of 4 possible outcomes: Two chances at having nothing happen, one chance of gaining a random crew member, and one chance of losing a crew member that can be negated by a clonebay.

* [ Rbl SF K: MStd; S: 0.2, 3-4, RStuff; Esc: 0.4, 3-4; CK: HStd ]

A ship fight against a Rebel class ship. Killing the ship gives medium scrap + 2 resources. Getting a crew kill gives high scrap + 2 resources. The ship has a chance of trying to escape/surrendering.

* [ Prt SF K: MStd; CK: HStd; DB: [ Crew+ | MStd | LStd | LWeap | +5 Hull | Nil ] ]

A ship fight against a Pirate class ship. Killing the ship gives medium scrap + 2 resources. Getting a crew kill gives high scrap + 2 resources. On defeating the ship (either via ship kill or crew kill), you will then get one of six outcomes: new crew member, medium scrap + 2 resources, low scrap + 2 resources, low scrap + weapon, 5 point hull repair, or nothing.

* [ Fleet-- ]

The fleet is delayed by 2 jumps
