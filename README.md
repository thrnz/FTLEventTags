What are the chances of losing crew to Giant Alien Spiders? Which Blue Option gives the best reward? When is a Crew Kill no better than a Ship Kill?

This mod tags dialogue to show the possible outcomes of various ingame choices and events. It doesn't effect the gameplay mechanics themselves in any way.

This mod is useful for players wanting to learn the possible results of ingame events. It is also useful for players wanting to play optimally without having to refer to the wiki or XML diving.

## Notes
 * Most ingame events have been tagged. Some may have been accidentally missed.
 * Mistakes may have been made. I take no responsibility for any runs lost as a result of incorrect information supplied by this mod!

## To-do
 * Needs plent of testing
 * Maybe tag possible enemy ship classes too.

One of 3 possible outcomes: either a ship fight with default rewards, nothing, or a free random weapon.

* [ x2 Nil | Crew+ | Crew- (CB+) ]

One of 4 possible outcomes: Two chances at having nothing happen, one chance of gaining a random crew member, and one chance of losing a crew member that can be negated by a clonebay.

A ship fight. Killing the ship gives medium scrap + 2 resources. Getting a crew kill gives high scrap + 2 resources.

The fleet is delayed by 2 jumps
