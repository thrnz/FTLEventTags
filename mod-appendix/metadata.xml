What are the chances of losing crew to Giant Alien Spiders? Which Blue Option gives the best reward? When is a Crew Kill no better than a Ship Kill?

This mod tags dialogue to show the possible outcomes of various ingame choices and events. It doesn't effect the gameplay mechanics themselves in any way.

This mod is useful for players wanting to learn the possible results of ingame events. It is also useful for players wanting to play optimally without having to refer to the wiki or XML diving.
